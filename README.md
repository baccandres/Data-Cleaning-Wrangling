Data Cleaning and Wrangling project

The project consists of an intensive cleaning of a low quality database, containing information about shark attacks.

The original database contains 25723 rows and 24 columns, which after the cleanse, are reduced to 6303 and 13 respectively.

This folder contains 2 jupyter notebooks and a '.py' file intended to have the functions used to clean the original database, but is empty as functions were found difficult to reuse in such a file.

The first jupyter, 'Attacks_Data_Cleaning', contains all the steps used to clean the original database.

The second one, 'Shark Attacks Analysis', contains a brief analysis of sharks' behavior when attacking people. E.g.: What is the most common time of the year when attacks happen, or what type of activity attracts the most attacks.

Open it and find out what is the best time for you to take a swim in Australia or South Africa!
